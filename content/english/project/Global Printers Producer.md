Our client is synonymous with innovative print and imaging technology, with offices spanning 41 countries. Founded in Japan, the multinational corporation has been operating in New Zealand for the past 60 years. A key to our client's success has been its ability to deliver a diverse range of products and services to customers. With the growth of products and services, our client initiated a digital transformation journey to enable their operational processes to scale and support their business.

### The Challenge
A major challenge for our client's digital transformation journey was modernising its core finance and operations to optimise their supply chain. They knew they had to introduce new systems as well as re-engineer their processes to industry leading best practices. But, where to start and how to collaborate with all stakeholders to align to new systems and practices? They needed leadership and support to understand what good would look like in their business to overcome inefficiencies and governance during the digital transformation.

### Key Outcomes
Our client has realised the benefits from their digital transformation focusing on value-add and removing waste. More specifically,we enabled our client to achieve:
1. A clear understanding of their ideal-state from the digital transformation, supported by processes and systems design
2. Project governance to continue identifying, measuring and tracking inefficiencies in processes during the digital transformation
3. An approach that collaborated and aligned stakeholders to clearly understanding their requirements before jumping to a solution.

### Our Difference
We were the chosen partner for our client, offering unique services to provide process excellence and project governance that:
1. Delivered leading industry standard processes as a template
2. Provided Lean analysis of processes saving time and cost
3. Surfaced key areas of inefficiencies to generate improvements based on process data
4. Enabled capturing both current-state and ideal-state process design to support change management initiatives with stakeholders
5. Proven methodology supported by deep knowledge and experience of processes and systems
6. Independent project governance and QA to ensure value is realised during the system implementation.

### Conclusion
We simply offered a uniquely different and data-driven way of understanding business requirements and generating an ideal-state for a digital transformation. We provided a process structure template using APQC’s Process Classification Framework® to align the client's processes with an industry standard taxonomy. This provided our client with a guiding structure for capturing current-state processes as well as potentially value-adding processes universally accepted as industry standards. By following this structure, they could be easily translated into system requirements that many solutions align to.
