Our client is a New Zealand fully integrated orchard-to-service business delivering premium produce to leading retailers and wholesalers, both in NZ and overseas. Since its establishment in early 80's, our client has grown to become New Zealand and Australia’s largest fruit grower as well as maintaining a reputation of being experts in supply chain management, comprising of orchard, harvest and post-harvest processes. 

### The Challenge
The rapid growth of our client's business, from producing a wide range of products to more markets, resulted in tremendous strain in internal processes and systems. Our client recognised that their processes needed to be streamlined and systems modernised for scalability. Currently, their processes were quite disparate and siloed among the various business units. Our client also saw an opportunity to adopt practices from the industry, especially in finance and operations. Whilst there are many finance and operations solutions in the market, Our client wanted to ensure they understood their pain points and opportunities with best practices. After undergoing a competitive vendor selection process, our client selected us to support them on their journey to defining requirements and a market scan of digital solutions.

### Key Outcomes
With our engagement, our client generated over 250 detailed requirements that addressed key inefficiencies in their current processes and systems. These requirements allowed our client to:
- Understand their end-to-end business architecture across finance and operations
- Build a common taxonomy of business processes based on industry standards using the APQC Process Classification Framework (PCF)®
- Uncover key areas of inefficiencies (bottlenecks and manual/duplicate effort) by value stream and process
- List specific outputs, workflow, integration, data objects and system functionality embedded in processes
- Create a future-state reporting architecture based on data elements across existing reports
- Produce a requirements list easily translated into system features for a market scan of solutions
- Create a current-state blueprint as input to the solution design

### Our Difference
We were the chosen partner for our client, offering unique services to provide process excellence that:
1. Adopted industry-standard processes and taxonomy useful in the selection of new systems
2. Automated the capturing and value stream analysis of processes saving time and cost
3. Surfaced key areas of inefficiencies to generate improvements based on process data
4. Enabled an online mechanism for capturing and sharing process information with stakeholders onsite and offsite
5. Proven methodology supported by deep knowledge and experience of processes and systems

### Conclusion
We offered a uniquely different and data-driven way of understanding business requirements and generating an ideal state for new systems. We provided a process structure template using APQC's Process Classification Framework® to align processes with an industry-standard taxonomy. This provided our client with a guiding structure for capturing current-state processes as well as potentially value-adding processes universally accepted as industry standards. By following this structure, they could be easily translated into system requirements that many solutions align to.
