Our client owns and operates the electricity distribution network to over 49,000 customers (homes, farms, businesses etc.) and has been operating for almost 100 years. The company has experienced continuous growth throughout the years in a region that is expected to develop another 35,000 potential dwellings in the next 30 years. With the rapid growth, there’s a need to ensure they’re compliant with New Zealand Standard for Public Safety (NZ7901).

### The Challenge
Our client needed to implement a public safety management system (PSMS) to comply with public safety standards. This required systems and processes to be in place for hazard and incident recording, and reporting. They needed a partner who could help with capturing their current-state processes and developing streamlined optimised-state processes that supported a PSMS.

### Key Outcomes
We helped our client achieve the following:
1.	Documented current-state processes with identified gaps and challenges, role mapping, data records, and systems
2.	Documented optimised-state processes with improvement points
3.	Documented key systems in the enterprise architecture that support the optimised-state processes.

### Our Difference
The key differences in using us included:
1.	Provided deep understanding of electricity distribution industry
2.	Applied Lean value stream analysis on processes to measure waste
3.	Incorporated industry standards on PSMS for incident and hazard reporting
4.	Adopted a systems approach to ensuring processes were relatable to EAM system.

### Conclusion
BPublic safety is a significant risk in this industry. To ensure electricity providers are compliant with the standards, they need the appropriate systems and processes in place. However, this needs to be balanced with performing processes in an efficient way. This is where we can help to ensure appropriate processes are developed and a clear understanding of the transition required from current to optimised-state.
