Pan Pac Forest Products provides sustainable and tailored forest products to domestic and international markets. Owned by Oji Group, a leader in the pulp and paper industry in Japan, Pan Pac has been growing, processing and delivering radiata products for over 50 years. In 2022, Pan Pac embarked on a company-wide digital transformation comprising of an ERP system implementation. This transformation provided Pan Pac with many benefits such as simplification/standardisation/consistency/agility of business processes, one source of the information and foundation for innovation with new technologies. However, with significant benefit, there was equally significant risk to the business.

### The Challenge
The digital transformation posed significant risk to Pan Pac’s business in terms of the impact to stakeholders and processes. They had reason to be concerned when 86% of companies experience delays in their ERP projects (IDG MarketPulse survey, ERP Integration & Modernization, April 2021). Pan Pac needed a trusted advisor with experience of delivering similar scale and complexity projects to help mitigate the risks. We were engaged to provide project governance and quality assurance over the project.

### Key Outcomes
Through our engagement, Pan Pac was able to achieve the following outcomes:
- Early alignment among stakeholders of the transformation’s vision and objectives across all business areas
- Completeness and accuracy of deliverables to quality standards and acceptance criteria
- Definition of user acceptance criteria consistent with original transformation objectives
- Independent voice in steering committee meetings to hold Pan Pac and vendors accountable
- Redesign of the IT function to support the ERP system in a BAU-state

### Our Difference
We were the chosen partner for our client, offering unique services to provide project governance that:
1. Delivered a pragmatic approach to project governance that not only operated at a project management-level, but help mitigate risks by deep-diving in areas of project delivery to uplift capability
2. Led from proven experience in delivering ERP system implementations and large-scale change programmes
3. Communicated and addressed concerns of stakeholders at an executive to team member-level
4. Provided deep knowledgeable of ERP support functions, roles and responsibilities

### Conclusion
Every project has unique circumstances that can present risks. Whilst our approach to project governance leverages industry best practices in project controls, we tailor the areas of focus depending on the need. We also support the team to fill gaps where there are capability and capacity challenges.
