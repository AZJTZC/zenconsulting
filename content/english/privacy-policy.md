### Purpose
This Privacy Policy ('Policy') sets out our approach to personal information including:

* how we collect, hold, use and disclose (collectively "manage") your personal information;
* how we aim to maintain the quality and security of your personal information;
* your rights to access and correct your personal information; and
* your rights to make a privacy complaint.
 
### Policy
We recognise each individual’s right to privacy and are committed to the confidentiality and protection of your personal information. 

We aim to manage personal information in an open and transparent way and to comply with all applicable privacy laws in the countries we operate in.

#### 1. Personal and sensitive information
In this Policy you will see the terms 'personal information' and 'sensitive information' used. These terms have the following definitions:
- 'personal information' means information that identifies you or can be used to identify you, or from which you are reasonably identifiable.
- 'sensitive information' is a sub-set of personal information and includes information about your health, race or ethnic origin, political opinions, memberships of trade unions or political associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences, or criminal history. Sensitive information is more protected under Privacy Laws than are other forms of personal information. 

In this Policy, and unless otherwise stated, all references to 'personal information' include 'sensitive information'.

#### 2. What personal information do we collect?
We collect and hold different categories of information depending on our relationship with you, the services being provided, and the jurisdiction in which those services are provided in.

The types of personal information we collect may include:
- Identifying information such as full name;
- Professional information such as position/job title, work address, work telephone number, work email address (particularly for our customers or suppliers);
- Marketing and communications information such as marketing and communications preferences, tracking data on whether you have read marketing communications from us, web analytics about your interactions with the Zen Consulting website;
- Electronic monitoring information to the extent the law allows, we may record and monitor your electronic communications with us;
- and services information such as invoice and payment details to and from you, details of services we provided to you, or you provided to us (particularly for our customers or suppliers).


#### 3. How we collect personal information?
We only collect personal information by lawful and fair means.

We collect personal information in a number of ways, including:
- when you purchase goods or services from us;
- when you correspond with us;
- when you or your employer provide (or update) personal information in connection with products and services we offer to you or them (for example, this could simply be your contact details on an invoice to your company);
- when you provide (or update) personal information in connection with products and services we offer to you, or that you offer to us;
- when you enquire or apply for employment with us;
- and when you use our website or interact with us through various digital platforms including social media (including subscribing to newsletters, downloading reports, or responding to surveys); and from publicly available information.

#### 4. Unsolicited information
As a general rule, personal information you give us beyond the information we ask for, will be treated as unsolicited personal information.

If we can keep this unsolicited personal information under applicable law, we will handle it as lawfully collected personal information. If the unsolicited personal information has no legitimate business purpose, we will destroy or de-identify the information in due course.
